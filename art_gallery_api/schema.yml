                    provenance_text: 'The nine images in Something More tell an ambiguous
                      tale of a young woman''s longing for ''something more'', a quest
                      which brings dashed hopes and the loss of innocence. With its
                      staged theatricality and storyboard framing, the series has
                      been described by critic Ingrid Perez as ''a collection of scenes
                      from a film that was never made''. While the film may never
                      have been made, we recognise its components from a shared cultural
                      memory of B-grade cinema and pulp fiction, from which Moffatt
                      has drawn this melodrama. The ''scenes'' can be displayed in
                      any order - in pairs, rows or as a grid - and so their storyline
                      is not fixed, although we piece together the arc from naïve
                      country girl to fallen woman abandoned on the roadside in whatever
                      arrangement they take. Moffatt capitalises on the cinematic
                      device of montage, mixing together continuous narrative, flashbacks,
                      cutaways, close-ups and memory or dream sequences, to structure
                      the series, and relies on our knowledge of these devices to
                      make sense and meaning out of the assemblage. Something More
                      was made while Moffatt was artist-in-residence at Albury Regional
                      Art Centre in May 1989, and was produced in conjunction with
                      staff and students of the photography department at the Centre
                      for Visual Arts Murray Campus of Charles Sturt University, the
                      artists of the Link Access studio and the general community
                      of Albury Wodonga. Moffatt ''stars'' as the beautiful ingénue
                      in the cheongsam, and conjures the stifling atmosphere of small-town
                      life in the cane fields of her native Queensland through vividly
                      painted sets. The pantomime feeling of the series is amplified
                      by the stereotypical characters of the trashy blonde and the
                      Chinese boy-next-door who feature alongside her, and the lush
                      colour saturation of the Cibachrome images. Something More is
                      the first of Moffatt''s photographic series which demonstrates
                      all of the elements that have made her work so acclaimed: its
                      theatrical staginess, its references to film, art and photographic
                      history and issues of race and gender.'

                    provenance_text: Vincent Namatjira sourced the material for The
                      Royal Tour from op-shops in Alice Springs, Northern Territory.
                      During the lockdowns for remote community members in the Northern
                      Territory as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, he was unable
                      to work in his studio. He devised the idea of working directly
                      onto the pages of the found source material, which included
                      magazines, books and other mass-produced paper works featuring
                      the British royal family. This meant he was able to paint at
                      a domestic size, at home in isolation. The artist states that
                      whenever he paints powerful figures - politicians, world leaders
                      or members of the royal family, for example - he is attempting
                      to disrupt or take away their power. He often does this by placing
                      the figures on Aboriginal land, out of their comfort zone, where
                      they are not considered leaders but are viewed as just another
                      visitor. He will also often place himself in the work, in “a
                      mischievous self-portrait, using a bit of cheeky humour kind
                      of as an equaliser - to put everyone on the same level.”[1]  There
                      are some synchronicities with the British monarchy and the Namatjira
                      family. While researching the Namatjira family history, Vincent
                      came to learn that his great-grandfather, the renowned artist
                      Albert Namatjira (1902-1959) had met Queen Elizabeth II when
                      she toured Australia in 1954. It was at this time that he had
                      bestowed upon him the Coronation Medal, a commemorative personal
                      souvenir awarded by the Queen to particularly noteworthy Commonwealth
                      subjects. The British royal family and the Coronation Medal
                      are seen by the artist as symbolic of wealth and power, able
                      to bestow social validation upon those who were considered part
                      of the lower echelons of society. The background of several
                      works in The Royal Tour have been painted in a stylistically
                      similar way tothe work of the artist's great-grandfather. It's
                      a sincere homage to Albert Namatjira's artistic technique, which
                      we now know revealed connections to his custodial Country. The
                      washed, confidently depicted backdrops are also a tribute to
                      the artists - many of whom are related to Vincent Namatjira
                      - at the Iltja Ntjarra (Many Hands) Art Centre, who continue
                      the artistic legacy of Albert Namatjira in their depictions
                      of Country. Vincent's Namatjira's work can be contextualised
                      within a broader artistic framework of humorous political representations
                      in Australian contemporary art. Similar to newspaper cartoons
                      with their leaning towards political satire, his work effortlessly
                      captures a particular generational critique of those who have
                      felt marginalised from the possibility of participating in or
                      influencing sovereignty over their own lives.

                    provenance_text: Daniel Boyd's work is concerned with the reinterpretation
                      of Aboriginal and Australian-European history. From the ethics
                      of colonisation to a more personal engagement with family history,
                      his work explores ideas of time and memory, drawing on imagery
                      that has personal, cultural and art-historical significance.
                      A recurring motif in Boyd's painting practice since 2011 is
                      the use of resin dots that he places over a painted image, which
                      is then overlaid with black pigment, resulting in a constellation
                      of semi-transparent 'lenses' that partially reveal the underlying
                      image. Obscured in veiled darkness, these contemplative and
                      intriguing paintings rendered in a tonal greyscale speak of
                      incomplete histories and multiplicities of perspectives, encouraging
                      the viewer to visually and intellectually fill in the gaps.
                      Untitled (PSM) is part of a series of paintings titled History
                      is Made at Night (Kochi) produced by Boyd specifically for the
                      Kochi-Muziris Biennale in Kochi, India in 2014. The four works
                      in this series explore narratives around the fifteenth-century
                      maritime 'age of discovery' and include Untitled (ZVC), a reworking
                      of an 1898 etching of a painting of Portuguese explorer Vasco
                      da Gama; Untitled (KC) 1 and Untitled (KC) 2, renderings of
                      eleventh-century gold coins of the Kilwa Sultanate in East Africa
                      found off the coast of Arnhem Land; and Untitled (PSM), a celestial
                      navigation chart based on a traditional navigational Polynesian
                      star map. These works collectively touch on notions of early
                      trade and exploration and their associated complex and uneasy
                      histories. These narratives have a personal resonance for Boyd,
                      whose paternal great-great-grandfather was brought from Pentecost
                      Island in Vanuatu to Queensland as a slave to work on the cane
                      fields. History is Made at Night (Kochi) follows on from Boyd's
                      exhibitions New Hebrides (2013) and Pineapples in the Pacific
                      (2014) at Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery, Sydney featuring a series of
                      paintings exploring similar ideas focused on Vanuatu.

                      tale of a young woman''s longing for ''something more'', a quest
                      which brings dashed hopes and the loss of innocence. With its
                      staged theatricality and storyboard framing, the series has
                      been described by critic Ingrid Perez as ''a collection of scenes
                      from a film that was never made''. While the film may never
                      have been made, we recognise its components from a shared cultural
                      memory of B-grade cinema and pulp fiction, from which Moffatt
                      has drawn this melodrama. The ''scenes'' can be displayed in
                      any order - in pairs, rows or as a grid - and so their storyline
                      is not fixed, although we piece together the arc from naïve
                      country girl to fallen woman abandoned on the roadside in whatever
                      arrangement they take. Moffatt capitalises on the cinematic
                      device of montage, mixing together continuous narrative, flashbacks,
                      cutaways, close-ups and memory or dream sequences, to structure
                      the series, and relies on our knowledge of these devices to
                      make sense and meaning out of the assemblage. Something More
                      was made while Moffatt was artist-in-residence at Albury Regional
                      Art Centre in May 1989, and was produced in conjunction with
                      staff and students of the photography department at the Centre
                      for Visual Arts Murray Campus of Charles Sturt University, the
                      artists of the Link Access studio and the general community
                      of Albury Wodonga. Moffatt ''stars'' as the beautiful ingénue
                      in the cheongsam, and conjures the stifling atmosphere of small-town
                      life in the cane fields of her native Queensland through vividly
                      painted sets. The pantomime feeling of the series is amplified
                      by the stereotypical characters of the trashy blonde and the
                      Chinese boy-next-door who feature alongside her, and the lush
                      colour saturation of the Cibachrome images. Something More is
                      the first of Moffatt''s photographic series which demonstrates
                      all of the elements that have made her work so acclaimed: its
                      theatrical staginess, its references to film, art and photographic
                      history and issues of race and gender.'

                    provenance_text: 'The nine images in Something More tell an ambiguous
                      tale of a young woman''s longing for ''something more'', a quest
                      which brings dashed hopes and the loss of innocence. With its
                      staged theatricality and storyboard framing, the series has
                      been described by critic Ingrid Perez as ''a collection of scenes
                      from a film that was never made''. While the film may never
                      have been made, we recognise its components from a shared cultural
                      memory of B-grade cinema and pulp fiction, from which Moffatt
                      has drawn this melodrama. The ''scenes'' can be displayed in
                      any order - in pairs, rows or as a grid - and so their storyline
                      is not fixed, although we piece together the arc from naïve
                      country girl to fallen woman abandoned on the roadside in whatever
                      arrangement they take. Moffatt capitalises on the cinematic
                      device of montage, mixing together continuous narrative, flashbacks,
                      cutaways, close-ups and memory or dream sequences, to structure
                      the series, and relies on our knowledge of these devices to
                      make sense and meaning out of the assemblage. Something More
                      was made while Moffatt was artist-in-residence at Albury Regional
                      Art Centre in May 1989, and was produced in conjunction with
                      staff and students of the photography department at the Centre
                      for Visual Arts Murray Campus of Charles Sturt University, the
                      artists of the Link Access studio and the general community
                      of Albury Wodonga. Moffatt ''stars'' as the beautiful ingénue
                      in the cheongsam, and conjures the stifling atmosphere of small-town
                      life in the cane fields of her native Queensland through vividly
                      painted sets. The pantomime feeling of the series is amplified
                      by the stereotypical characters of the trashy blonde and the
                      Chinese boy-next-door who feature alongside her, and the lush
                      colour saturation of the Cibachrome images. Something More is
                      the first of Moffatt''s photographic series which demonstrates
                      all of the elements that have made her work so acclaimed: its
                      theatrical staginess, its references to film, art and photographic
                      history and issues of race and gender.'

                    provenance_text: Vincent Namatjira sourced the material for The
                      Royal Tour from op-shops in Alice Springs, Northern Territory.
                      During the lockdowns for remote community members in the Northern
                      Territory as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, he was unable
                      to work in his studio. He devised the idea of working directly
                      onto the pages of the found source material, which included
                      magazines, books and other mass-produced paper works featuring
                      the British royal family. This meant he was able to paint at
                      a domestic size, at home in isolation. The artist states that
                      whenever he paints powerful figures - politicians, world leaders
                      or members of the royal family, for example - he is attempting
                      to disrupt or take away their power. He often does this by placing
                      the figures on Aboriginal land, out of their comfort zone, where
                      they are not considered leaders but are viewed as just another
                      visitor. He will also often place himself in the work, in “a
                      mischievous self-portrait, using a bit of cheeky humour kind
                      of as an equaliser - to put everyone on the same level.”[1]  There
                      are some synchronicities with the British monarchy and the Namatjira
                      family. While researching the Namatjira family history, Vincent
                      came to learn that his great-grandfather, the renowned artist
                      Albert Namatjira (1902-1959) had met Queen Elizabeth II when
                      she toured Australia in 1954. It was at this time that he had
                      bestowed upon him the Coronation Medal, a commemorative personal
                      souvenir awarded by the Queen to particularly noteworthy Commonwealth
                      subjects. The British royal family and the Coronation Medal
                      are seen by the artist as symbolic of wealth and power, able
                      to bestow social validation upon those who were considered part
                      of the lower echelons of society. The background of several
                      works in The Royal Tour have been painted in a stylistically
                      similar way tothe work of the artist's great-grandfather. It's
                      a sincere homage to Albert Namatjira's artistic technique, which
                      we now know revealed connections to his custodial Country. The
                      washed, confidently depicted backdrops are also a tribute to
                      the artists - many of whom are related to Vincent Namatjira
                      - at the Iltja Ntjarra (Many Hands) Art Centre, who continue
                      the artistic legacy of Albert Namatjira in their depictions
                      of Country. Vincent's Namatjira's work can be contextualised
                      within a broader artistic framework of humorous political representations
                      in Australian contemporary art. Similar to newspaper cartoons
                      with their leaning towards political satire, his work effortlessly
                      captures a particular generational critique of those who have
                      felt marginalised from the possibility of participating in or
                      influencing sovereignty over their own lives.
